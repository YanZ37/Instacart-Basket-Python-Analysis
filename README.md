# 🛒 Instacart Basket Analysis

## 📘 Overview & Objective
As an analyst at **Instacart**, an online grocery delivery platform, the goal of this project was to analyze sales data and uncover patterns in customer behavior.  
Although Instacart already has strong sales, stakeholders wanted deeper insights into **sales patterns**, **customer segmentation**, and **marketing opportunities**.  

The analysis aimed to identify distinct **customer profiles** and provide strategies to tailor marketing efforts accordingly.  
Key business questions focused on:
- What are the **busiest days and hours** for orders?  
- How can we measure **customer loyalty**?  
- How do **ordering habits** differ across demographics?  
- Which **products and departments** are most popular?

## 📊 Datasets
The analysis used several comprehensive datasets containing customer and order information:

- `orders`  
- `orders_products_prior`  
- `products`  
- `customers`  
- `departments`

These datasets were merged, cleaned, and analyzed to identify purchasing trends, loyalty patterns, and sales drivers.
